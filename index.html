        What is Programming Language ?
    </h2>
    <P class="paragraph">
        A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of<br>output.
        Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms and manipulate<br>data structures.
        They enable humans to communicate with computers and create software applications<br> operating systems, games, and more.

        Key Characteristics of Programming Languages
    </h2>
    <P class="paragraph2">
    <ul>
     <li>  Syntax : The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs in that <br>language.</li> <br>
      <li>  Semantics : The meaning of the syntactically correct statements. It defines what the program does when executed.</li> <br>
      <li>  Pragmatics : How the language is used in practice, including coding conventions, idioms, and the practical aspects of programming<br> in that language.</li> <br>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="programming">
        Types of Programming Languages
    </h2>

       <h4 class="para2"> 1. Low-Level Languages - </h4>
    <p class="para">
       These are closer to machine code and include:</p>

      <ul> <li> Machine Language: The lowest-level programming language, consisting of binary code that the computer's central processing unit (CPU)<br> can directly execute.</li> <br>

          <li> Assembly Language: A step above machine language, using symbolic names for operations and memory addresses. It requires an <br>assembler to convert it to machine code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="para2">2. High-Level Languages - </h4>
    <p class="para"> These are closer to human languages and further from machine code, making them easier to program in.<br> They include:<br></p>
   <ul>
   <li> Procedural Languages:
    Focus on a sequence of commands or steps to be executed. Examples include C, Pascal, and FORTRAN.</li> <br>
       <li>  Object-Oriented Languages:
    Organize code into objects, which contain both data and methods. Examples include Java, C++, Python,<br> and Ruby.</li> <br>
       <li>Functional Languages:
    Focus on mathematical functions and immutability. Examples include Haskell, Lisp, and Erlang.</li> <br>
       <li> Scripting Languages:
    Often used for automating tasks and are interpreted rather than compiled. Examples include JavaScript, PHP,<br> Perl, and Python.</li> <br>
       <li> Declarative Languages:
    Focus on what the program should accomplish rather than how to accomplish it. Examples include SQL for<br> databases and HTML for web pages.</li> <br>
   </ul>

<h2 class="programming">Examples of Programming Languages</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Python :
        Known for its readability and broad library support. Used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.</li> <br>
    <li> Java :
        Widely used in enterprise environments, web development, and Android app development.</li> <br>
    <li>C++ :
        An extension of C that includes object-oriented features. Used in system/software development, game development, and<br> high-performance applications.</li> <br>
    <li>JavaScript :
        Primarily used for web development to create interactive web pages.</li> <br>
    <li>Ruby :
        Known for its simplicity and productivity, often used in web development with the Ruby on Rails framework.</li> <br>
    <li> Swift :
        Developed by Apple for iOS and macOS application development.</li> <br>
    <li>Go (Golang) :
        Developed by Google, known for its simplicity and efficiency in concurrent programming.</li> <br>
    </ul>
<h2 class="programming">Importance of Programming Languages</h2>
  <ul>
      <li> Software Development: All software applications, from operating systems to games and mobile apps, are written in programming languages.</li> <br>
      <li> Automation: Programming languages are used to automate repetitive tasks, thereby increasing efficiency.</li> <br>
      <li> Data Analysis: Languages like Python and R are heavily used in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical computing.</li> <br>
      <li>  Web Development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are essential for creating and maintaining websites.</li> <br>
      <li>   Education and Research: Used for teaching programming concepts and conducting computational research </li> <br>
  </ul>
    <h2 class="programming">Conclusion</h2>
   <p class="paragraph"> Programming languages are essential tools that enable developers to write instructions for computers to perform<br>specific tasks.
    They range from low-level languages that interact closely with hardware to high-level languages that <br> abstract much of the complexity, allowing for rapid development and ease of use.
    Understanding different programming languages and their applications is crucial for anyone looking to pursue a career in technology or related fields.
